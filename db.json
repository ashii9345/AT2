In 1988, the model was fitted with one of the best self-winding chronograph movements at the time. Rolex engineers worked to optimize this mechanism – calibre 4030 with a Perpetual rotor – to further enhance its reliability. In 2000, the presentation of the Rolex 4130 calibre (which became the 4131 in 2023) perpetuated the quest for excellence initiated by the brand’s founder, Hans Wilsdorf. Developed and produced by Rolex, it has proven to be particularly reliable and durable under even the most challenging conditions."

Enter Machine Luxe, featuring a 37mm statement shaped case inspired by Nick's distinct personal style, a croc-embossed leather strap, and a signature knurled bezel characteristic of every Machine watch. Finely etched lines fan out from the center of the dial, creating a radiant sunray texture in a striking blue vignette."
